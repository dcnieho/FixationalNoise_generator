This repository contains the fixational eye movement data generator code used and developed for the article: Niehorster, D.C., Zemblys, R., Beelders, T. & Holmqvist, K. (in press). Characterizing gaze position signals and synthesizing noise during fixations in eye-tracking data. Behavior Research Methods

When using the code in this repository, please cite the paper. The recorded data and analysis code used in Niehorster, Zemblys, Beelders & Holmqvist (in press) can be found [here](https://github.com/dcnieho/FixationalNoise_data).

## Contents
1. To use the fixational eye movement data generator for your own use, run `main.m`
2. To generate Figures 5 and 6 in the above paper, run `a_generatePaperFigures.m`.
3. To perform the analysis underlying Figure 7 and make that figure, run `a_windowLengthAnalysis.m`. __Warning__: this function consumes well north of 10GB of RAM and takes many hours to run.

Tested on MATLAB R2020a
